# Python-Notes
Welcome to my personal Python notes repository! This repository includes all the concepts, snippets, and ideas I’ve learned while exploring Python programming. These notes are meant to serve as a quick reference and to document my progress as I deepen my knowledge of Python.

### Table of Contents

- Introduction
- Basics of Python
- Control Flow
- Functions
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Error Handling
- Modules and Packages
- File Handling

These notes cover Python programming topics I’ve learned on my own through practice, tutorials, and projects. They include code snippets, explanations, and examples that I’ve found useful.

### Basics of Python

1. Variables: Declaration and types
2. Data Types: Numbers, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets
3. Operators: Arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise

### Control Flow

1. Conditionals: if, elif, else statements
2. Loops: for and while loops
3. Comprehensions: List, dictionary, and set comprehensions
4. Break and Continue: Flow control in loops

### Functions

1. Defining Functions: def, arguments, return values
2. Lambda Functions: Anonymous functions
3. Scopes: Global and local scope, global and nonlocal keywords
4. Recursive Functions: Recursion in Python

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

1. Classes and Objects: Defining and instantiating classes
2. Attributes and Methods: Instance and class methods
3. Inheritance: Single and multiple inheritance
4. Encapsulation and Polymorphism: Data hiding, method overriding
5. Special Methods: __init__, __str__, __repr__, etc.

### Error Handling

1. Try and Except: Catching exceptions
2. Finally: Code that always runs
3. Custom Exceptions: Creating user-defined exceptions

### Modules and Packages

1. Importing Modules: Built-in and external libraries
2. Creating Packages: Organizing code with packages
3. Virtual Environments: Managing project dependencies

### File Handling

1. Reading/Writing Files: Opening files in different modes (r, w, a)
2. Working with CSV and JSON: Parsing and writing structured data

This is a personal project, but if you spot any mistakes or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to submit an issue or a pull request.
